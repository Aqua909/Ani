## General
This is the GitHub Repository for the [AniSearch Discord Bot](https://top.gg/bot/737236600878137363). AniSearch is an easy-to-use Discord bot written in Python that allows you to search for Anime, Manga, Characters, Staff, Studios and Profiles right within [Discord](https://discord.com/) and displays the results from [AniList](https://anilist.co) and [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/)!

If you are interested in my bot, you can add it to your Discord server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=737236600878137363&permissions=83968&scope=bot)!

If you would like to contact me, add me as a friend via Discord: `IchBinLeoon#9999`

## Bot Commands
A full documentation of AniSearch's commands can be found [here](https://top.gg/bot/737236600878137363) or with the command `as!help` if you have invited the bot to your server.

## Contribute
You have an idea or found a bug? Create [a new issue](https://github.com/IchBinLeoon/anisearch-discord-bot/issues) with detailed explanation.

## Hosting the Bot
Self-hosting is fully unsupported. Even so, I kindly ask you not to try. Not only will it not work properly, I also recommend everyone to use the official instance of the bot instead, which you can find [here](https://top.gg/bot/737236600878137363)!
