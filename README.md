# üöÄ Running
**I would prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot unless you want to contribute to the code.** 

Use the official instance instead, which you can add to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=737236600878137363&permissions=92224&scope=bot%20applications.commands)!

Nevertheless, the installation steps are as follows:  

1. Make sure `Docker` and `Docker-Compose` are installed.

2. Clone the repository.
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/IchBinLeoon/anisearch-discord-bot
    ```
    
3. Change the working directory.
    ```
    $ cd anisearch-discord-bot
    ```
    
4. Create a [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

5. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.

6. Edit `.env` and fill in `BOT_TOKEN`, `BOT_OWNER_ID` and `BOT_SAUCENAO_API_KEY`.
    ```
    # The token the bot will use for auth with Discord.
    BOT_TOKEN=
    
    # The Discord ID of the user hosting the bot.
    BOT_OWNER_ID=
    
    # The SauceNAO API key. Is required for the `source` command.
    BOT_SAUCENAO_API_KEY=
